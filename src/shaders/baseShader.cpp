/*
goals of this shader system:

handle agnostic texture sources from within maya as shader inputs, not just
singular external textures

handle maya float and vector arrays of varying size as live buffer inputs;
if this is unfeasible, then a separate system to convert per-point attributes
to maya textures before input to shader
