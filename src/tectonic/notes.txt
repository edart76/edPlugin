notes on any maths stuff I learn from doing this


Matrix Trace - sum of diagonal entries in matrix
 - in identity mat, trace is sum of the matrix dimension (obviously)
 - trace of matrix product is the same as
	sum of piecewise products of trace entries
 - trace is equal to sum of eigenvalues
 - mean of trace entries equal to mean of evalues (3b1b)

Determinant is basically cheat code
 - equal to product of eigen values

Kronecker product - product of MatA(x, y) and MatB(n, m), yields gigantic matrix M(x * n, y * m) - entry M(1, 1) = MatA[1, 1] * MatB.
 - Each entry is equivalent to entire matrix B multiplied by A entry.

Idempotent matrix - a matrix which when multiplied by itself, yields itself.
 - Eigenvalues are always 0 or 1

Nilpotent matrix - matrix * matrix = 0

eigenvalues

for square matrix, determinant = ad - bc
Eigen values are lambda values added to diagonal to force determinant
to 0,
[3, 4,                       [3 - L, 4,   ]      
 2, 1], det = 3 - 8 = -5      2,    1 - L ],


 det = (3 - L)(1 - L) - 5
 = 3 + L^2 - 4L - 5
 = L^2 - 4L - 2 // characteristic polynomial

 roots of this are eigen values - solve using quad formula

 OR
 L1L2 = -5 // determinant
 L1 + L2 = 4 // trace sum
 L1 = -1, L2 = 5 // or other way round

 3b1b shows easier method from mean

 trace / 2 = 2
 (L1 + L2) / 2 = 2
 L1 = (2 - d) // equal displacement for each
 L2 = (2 + d)

 -5 = 4 - d^2 // product and determinant
 -9 = -d^2
 3 = d
 L1 = 2 - 3 = -1
 L2 = 2 + 5 = 5

 for product p, mean m, distance d:
 d^2 = m^2 - p
 so where 2 values are linked by mean and product,
 v1, v2 = m +- root( m^2 - p)

 m being the mean of the trace, and p being determinant
